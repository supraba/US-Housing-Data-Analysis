# US-Housing-Data-Analysis

Analysed the United States housing data to determine if the mean housing price in university towns (cities with a high percentage of university students) was less affected by recession compared to non-university towns. Also, a t-test was performed and a p-value below the significance level was obtained which helped prove the above hypothesis.
